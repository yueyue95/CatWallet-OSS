# Contributing to CatWallet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CatWallet.

CatWallet is a privacy-first, self-hosted personal finance application. The project uses pull requests, protected branches, automated checks, and semantic versioning.

## Language

All code, comments, pull requests, issues, documentation, labels, and UI text must be written in English.

English is the source language for code and contributor communication. Product copy may also be translated into Simplified Chinese and Portuguese. Keep `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` structurally aligned whenever either changes.

## Git flow

The repository follows a lightweight Git Flow model:

- `main`: stable branch. Only release-ready code should be merged here.
- `develop`: integration branch for the next release.
- `feature/*`: new features.
- `fix/*`: bug fixes.
- `chore/*`: maintenance, tooling, documentation, CI.
- `release/*`: release stabilization branches.
- `hotfix/*`: urgent fixes created from `main`.

Expected flow:

```txt
feature/* -> develop -> release/* -> main
hotfix/*  -> main -> develop
```

Direct pushes to `main` should not be allowed. All changes must enter `main` through pull requests.

## Branch naming

Use short, descriptive branch names:

```txt
feature/add-recurring-transactions
fix/dashboard-budget-overflow
chore/add-ci-pipeline
release/v0.1.0-alpha
hotfix/auth-callback-redirect
```

## Commit convention

Use Conventional Commits:

```txt
feat: add category budget limits
fix: correct credit card closing date calculation
docs: update Supabase setup guide
test: add transaction aggregation tests
ci: add pull request checks
chore: update dependencies
refactor: simplify dashboard calculations
```

Accepted commit types:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `docs`
- `test`
- `ci`
- `chore`
- `refactor`
- `style`
- `perf`
- `build`
- `revert`

## Code standards

The coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` are the verified initial OSS non-regression baseline. Do not lower them. When a change raises any global metric sustainably, update that threshold upward in the same pull request.

- Use TypeScript.
- Keep components reusable.
- Follow the existing project structure.
- Keep business logic outside UI components when possible.
- Prefer existing shadcn/ui primitives.
- Use existing translation keys instead of ad hoc UI text.
- Keep data fetching and mutations in server-side modules or Server Actions when credentials or ownership checks matter.
- Validate Server Action input at runtime before writing to Supabase.
- Verify user ownership for any mutation that receives database IDs from the client.
- Do not introduce service-role operations into client-rendered code.
- Keep Supabase SSR clients in `lib/supabase/*` unless a new boundary is needed.
- Keep finance reads and business logic in `lib/finance/*` instead of UI components.
- Keep desktop dialogs, except the new transaction dialog, at the project standard of 50vw by 50vh.

## Supabase changes

- Add SQL migrations under `supabase/migrations`.
- Keep RLS policies aligned with authenticated user ownership.
- Keep privileged helper functions in a private or otherwise unexposed schema.
- Do not use `user_metadata` for authorization decisions.
- Do not expose Supabase service-role credentials to the browser.
- When transactions reference categories or payment methods, preserve same-user ownership guarantees.
- Preserve LGPD/privacy workflow support when changing user-owned tables.

## Pull requests

Before opening a pull request:

```bash
corepack pnpm run lint
corepack pnpm run test:coverage
corepack pnpm run build
```

A pull request should include:

- Clear description of the change.
- Linked issue when applicable.
- Screenshots or videos for UI changes.
- Migration notes for database changes.
- Test notes.

Keep PRs small and focused.

## Issues

Use clear issue titles and include enough context for maintainers to reproduce or evaluate the request.

For bugs, include:

- What happened.
- What was expected.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Browser/device information.
- Screenshots if relevant.

For features, include:

- The user problem.
- Proposed behavior.
- Alternatives considered.

## Releases

CatWallet uses semantic versioning.

Initial public releases should use pre-release tags until the app is production-ready, for example:

```txt
v0.1.0-alpha.1
v0.1.0-beta.1
v1.0.0
```

Use `CHANGELOG.md` as the release checklist source until a dedicated release-process document exists.
